            <p>Daily Bazzar operates as an online marketplace enabling users to order essentials including groceries, fresh produce, meats, seafood, dairy products, bakery items, and household supplies from local vendors in Jorhat, Assam. Daily Bazzar merely facilitates transactions between users and independent vendors and does not sell or stock products directly. The contract of sale exists solely between you and the respective vendor. While we endeavor to ensure that vendors provide accurate product descriptions and high service quality, Daily Bazzar does not guarantee, certify, or warrant the accuracy, quality, legality, or suitability of products listed on the Platform.</p>
            <p>You are solely responsible for providing accurate personal information, including your delivery address and contact details. We shall not be liable for any failure to deliver orders or any additional costs incurred due to incorrect or incomplete information provided by you.</p>
            <p>Daily Bazzar operates on a per-order basis, without subscription or membership fees. All transactions are one-time purchases unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Orders, Pricing, and Payments</h2>
            <p>Daily Bazzar provides a platform for cash-on-delivery (COD) and online payments through trusted third-party payment gateways. Your payment data is processed securely and used solely for the purpose of completing your transaction.</p>
            <p>All prices displayed on the Platform include applicable taxes (including GST) as required under Indian law. Any delivery fee, service charge, or other applicable cost will be transparently displayed at checkout before you confirm your order. Prices, offers, and availability are subject to change without prior notice. Errors in pricing or descriptions may occur, and Daily Bazzar reserves the right to correct such errors and cancel orders affected by them. If this occurs, you will be notified, and any payment collected will be refunded as per our Refund Policy.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Delivery Policy</h2>
            <p>Daily Bazzar coordinates deliveries through our own logistics team and third-party delivery service providers. Delivery personnel are not employees of Daily Bazzar. You or an authorized recipient must be present at the delivery location to accept the order. Should you instruct our delivery agent to leave the goods unattended, you accept full responsibility and risk for such delivery. In cases where delivery is not possible due to your unavailability, incorrect address, or any other reason attributable to you, we reserve the right to cancel or reschedule delivery at your expense.</p>
            <p>Estimated delivery timelines are displayed at the time of checkout. However, all delivery timelines are indicative and may vary due to factors beyond our control, including weather, traffic, or operational delays. Once an order is dispatched, it cannot be cancelled.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Return and Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>Perishable items, including but not limited to fruits, vegetables, dairy, fresh meats, seafood, and bakery products, are non-returnable once delivered, unless they are defective, spoiled, or not as described. If you receive such an item in unsatisfactory condition, you must report it to us within 12 hours of delivery through our customer support channels. We will review your claim and, if justified, process a refund or replacement at our discretion.</p>
            <p>Non-perishable, unopened, and undamaged goods may be eligible for return within 48 hours of delivery, provided they are in original condition and packaging. Returns must be initiated through customer support, and returned goods must be handed over to our designated pickup agent or delivered to a specified return center.</p>
            <p>Refunds will be processed to the original payment method for online transactions. For COD orders, refunds will typically be provided as store credit or promotional credit, subject to a validity period. Refunds are processed within 7 business days from receipt and verification of returned goods.</p>
