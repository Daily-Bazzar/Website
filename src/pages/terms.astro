            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Services Overview</h2>
            <p>Daily Bazzar is an app for ordering essentials (groceries, fruits & vegetables, meat, fish, household items etc.) from local vendors in Jorhat. By using our app, you agree to these terms. We operate only within Jorhat.<br/><br/>All products are sold by independent vendors, and each transaction is strictly between you and the company. Daily Bazzar merely facilitates the platform; it is not the seller of any products. We do not control vendor practices or product content, so we cannot guarantee accuracy of listings.<br/><br/>You must provide accurate contact and delivery information. If you give incorrect details or are unavailable at delivery, Daily Bazzar is not responsible for delays or non-delivery. We hold customers "solely responsible for providing the correct delivery details," and if an order is delayed or returned due to wrong information, Daily Bazzar is not liable and any redelivery costs are your responsibility.<br/><br/>Daily Bazzar does not charge any subscription or membership fee. Each order is a one-time purchase with no recurring obligations.<br/><br/>We strive to display product information accurately (images, descriptions, etc.), but actual products may vary. We make no warranties about any product. We disclaim all warranties and do not guarantee product descriptions. We provide the service "as is" and do not endorse or certify any item beyond what is shown on our platform.</p>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Orders and Payments</h2>
            <p>We accept Cash on Delivery (COD) and online payments (credit/debit cards, UPI, wallets). All online payments are processed securely. Payment details are encrypted and used only to complete your order. We will not use your financial information for any purpose other than processing the transaction.<br/><br/>If you choose COD, you must pay the exact order amount to the delivery person. Daily Bazzar is not responsible for any discrepancy if you overpay or underpay.<br/><br/>Product prices (including applicable taxes) and any delivery or service fees will be shown before you confirm an order. Daily Bazzar is not liable for pricing errors caused by vendors. Any additional charges (delivery fee, handling, surge pricing, etc.) will be clearly disclosed at checkout.</p>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Delivery Policy</h2>
            <p>Orders are delivered by our own drivers or delivery agency. The delivery partners of the agency  are not employees or agents of Daily Bazzar.<br/><br/>Someone must be available to receive the order at the address and time you specify. If you instruct the delivery person to leave items unattended, you assume all risk after delivery. If an order cannot be delivered due to an incorrect address or no recipient, we may cancel or reroute the order at your cost. We cannot cancel or change orders once they are out for delivery.<br/><br/>A delivery fee may apply to each order. The exact fee will be displayed in the app at checkout. We may waive the fee for orders above a certain amount; any minimum or free-delivery threshold will be shown to you.</p>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Return and Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>Fresh produce, meats, fish, dairy, bakery items and other perishables are non-returnable due to hygiene. However, if a perishable item arrives damaged, spoiled, or clearly not as described, contact us within 12 hours of delivery. We will evaluate your claim and, at our discretion, arrange a refund or replacement for that item.<br/><br/>Unopened, undamaged packaged goods (canned foods, cleaning products, personal care items, etc.) can be returned within 2 days of delivery. Items must be in original condition and packaging. To return an item, please contact customer support for instructions. Once we receive and verify the return, we will issue a refund.<br/><br/>For online payments, refunds will be credited to your original payment method. For COD orders, refunds are typically issued as store credit or promotional credit. If we issue a promo code as a refund, it will have a validity period (e.g. 30 days) and cannot be converted to cash. Once a refund is processed, it cannot be transferred to another payment mode.<br/><br/>Certain items (e.g., personal hygiene products, opened goods) cannot be returned or exchanged for any reason, except as required by law.</p>
